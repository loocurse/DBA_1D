# 40.002 Data and Business Analytics 1D Project

## Project information

### Project background
Low volatility can be a very effective predictor for future returns in China A- shares market.  However, we have observed that we need to carefully understand and build a low volatility signal that is indicative of not only a stock’s current volatility, but also its future volatility.

### Project objectives
We would like to build a company-level predictive model for identifying stocks with low future volatility. We will look to combine company fundamental data (from the income statement and balance sheet) with trailing volatility and return information to build a better forecast for future volatility of a company.

Our company will provide all the data and sub-indicators in easily usable formats to facilitate the project. 

### Project deliverables

The students are required to deliver a predictive model generating a quantitative signal that is indicative of a company’s future volatility over the next 1 year.

## Approach

Using time-series analysis (ARIMA) model
